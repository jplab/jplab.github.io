<p> 
I am a Teaching Professor (Professeur enseignement) at the <i>Département des Enseignements Généraux</i> of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.etsmtl.ca">École de Technologie supérieure</a> in Montréal which is within the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.uquebec.ca">Université du Québec</a>.
</p>

<p>
I completed my German <a href="https://refubium.fu-berlin.de/handle/fub188/28395">Habilitation</a> (including a dissertation, teaching experience (in German), teaching assessment, and 2-hours Habilitation Lecture) in July 2020. My Habilitation Lecture was on <i>Jones' Unknotting Conjecture</i>.  
Between December 2020 and November 2021, I was Privatdozent at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the Freie Universität Berlin.</p>

<p>
Between October 2016 and September 2020, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.math.fu-berlin.de/groups/discgeom/index.html">Discrete Geometry workgroup</a></li> of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/">Freie Universität Berlin</a></li> as a member of the SFB Project <a href="http://www.discretization.de/en/">Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics</a>. I was a junior faculty member of the Berlin Mathematical School and of the Research Training Group <a href="http://www.facetsofcomplexity.de/">Facets of complexity</a>. </p>

<p>Between October 2014 and September 2016, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/">Einstein Institute of Mathematics</a> of the <a href="http://new.huji.ac.il/en">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>. My advisor was <a href="http://www.math.huji.ac.il/~nevo/">Eran Nevo</a>. I was also a Postdoctoral Research Fellow of the <a href="http://www.frqnt.gouv.qc.ca/en/">Fonds Québécois de recherche</a> doing research in collaboration with <a href="https://personales.unican.es/santosf/">Francisco Santos</a> at the Universidad de Cantabria.</p>

<p>Between July 2013 and June 2014, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/">Freie Universität Berlin</a> as a member of the SFB Project <a href="http://www.discretization.de/en/">Discretization in Geometry and Dynamics</a>.</p>

<p>Between October 2010 and July 2013, I did my doctoral studies in Mathematics under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/math/groups/discgeom/ziegler">Günter M. Ziegler</a>. My thesis focused on discrete geometry and algebraic combinatorics, namely on the theory of polytopes and their interaction with the theory of Coxeter groups.</p>

<p><strong>Research interests</strong></p>

<p>My speciality lies in unifying computational, combinatorial, and geometric methods to create novel frameworks to study structures in algebra, geometry, and quantum physics.
In particular, my research merges large-scale computational experimentations and abstract modelizations to tackle open problems related to Coxeter and reflection groups, polytopes (in particular the permutahedra, associahedra and their generalizations), triangulations, and simplicial complexes.</p>

<p>In general, I appreciate particularly problems related to the following themes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Algebra: representation theory, Coxeter groups, infinite root systems, Lie groups, cluster algebras</li>
<li>Combinatorics: counting problems, combinatorics on words, lattice theory, relation to algebraic structures</li>
<li>Convex Geometry: triangulations, realization spaces of polytopes, permutahedra, associahedra and their generalizations</li>
<li>Computational geometry and algebra: generation problems, isomorphism problems, complexity, visualization tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not an expert, I appreciate to hear about</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Quantum physics</li>
<li>Computational complexity, imagery, tilings, fractals</li>
<li>Toric varieties and lattice polytopes</li>
<li>Tropical geometry</li>
<li>Hyperbolic geometry</li>
</ul>
